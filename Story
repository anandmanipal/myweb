<h1> Phase Transition: Notes</h1>



<h2>What is the spontaneously broken symmetry group for the liquid-gas ? </h2> 

<p>Landau's phenomenology of spontaneous symmetry breaking is applicable
when the phase transition is continuous (of second order). The liquid
gas transition is of first order (both liquid and gaseous states can
coexist right at the critical point, and are metastable in a finite
region around the transition; think of vapor bubbles in a boiling pot
of water).

A first order transition is noticeable not because there is a
structural change in the medium, but because there is a sudden change
in the medium. The macroscopic property that changes can still play the
role of an order parameter, though. For the liquid gas transition, it
is the density. As a vapor is cooled down or put under increasing
pressure, at some point it becomes more energetically favorable for it
to be at a higher density. The finite jump in the density gives the
transition its discontinuous (first order) character. However, at
higher temperatures and pressures, this density jump disapears and so
does the actual transition.

It is worth mentioning that at zero temperature, a continuous
transition is possible without any symmetry breaking. In such a
situation, one is said to have found a Quantum Critical Point. It's a
hot reasearch topic in current condensed matter physics. Some people
believe that superconductivity is hiding such a quantum critical point
on the phase diagram of the cuprate high temperature superconductors.
</p>

<p>There IS symmetry breaking around the Quantum Critical Point. For 2+1D
nonlinear sigma model phase transition is controlled by varying the
spin stiffness at zero temperature.

The real example of departure from the conventional Landau's paradigm
is the fractional quantum hall effect, where the ground state is the
Laughlin state. There is a gap between the ground state and the excited
states, without the typical gapless Goldstone modes.</p>

<p> Amorphous ice is an example of a metastable phase. It represents a local minimum of the free energy, but not the global minimum. </p>

<h1> First Three Min</h1>
<p>One truly fascinating consequence of modem theories of
elementary particles is that the universe may have suffered
a phase transition, like the freezing of water when it falls
below 273° K (=0°C). This phase transition is associated
not with the strong interactions, but with the other class of
short-range interaction in particle physics, the weak interactions. <br>
CRITICAL TEMPERATURE The temperature at which a phase
transition occurs. <br/>
PHASE TRANSITION The sharp transition of a system from one
configuration to another, usually with a change in symmetry.
Examples include melting, boiling, and the transition from
ordinary conductivity to superconductivity.</p>

<p>  Here, the term <b>phase</b> is refer as a states of matter. For example, water can exist in liquid, solid, and gas phases. In each phase, the water molecules interact differently, and the aggregate of many molecules has distinct physical properties. Condensed matter systems can have interesting and exotic phases, such as superfluid, superconducting, and quantum critical phases. Quantum fields such as the Higgs field can also exist in different phases.</p>


<h1> Superconductivity - A very short Introduction</h1>

<b>Phase transitions</b> <br/>
<p>When an ice cube melts, or the water in a kettle boils, there is said
to be a phase transition. Solid ice changes to liquid water, or liquid
water changes to gaseous steam. Phase transitions are rather
unusual phenomena: water at 308C is not very different to water at
288C, it’s just a bit warmer. The molecules wiggle around a bit
faster, but there is a continuum that exists between water at 288C
and water at 308C. However, there is something very, very different
between water at 18C and ice at 18C. The two things are entirely
different. Passing through the phase transition at 08C, when water
freezes, changes its nature discontinuously. </p>

<p>Another example is what is known as a ferromagnet, which is a
material which can exhibit spontaneous magnetism. A good
example of a ferromagnet is iron. Iron can display spontaneous
magnetism: all the tiny atomic magnets in a piece of iron can point
in the same direction (the left-hand picture in Figure 17), making
the piece of iron magnetic; paper clips will stick to it! However, if
you warm the piece of iron up to very high temperature (above
1043K, which is 7708C), it will lose its magnetism when you pass
through the ferromagnetic transition temperature (called the Curie
point, in honour of the French physicist Pierre Curie, whose more
famous wife, Marie Curie, is known for her discovery of radium).
At high temperature, all the little atomic magnets will point
randomly (the right-hand picture in Figure 17). This change
between magnetic and non-magnetic states at the Curie point is
another example of a phase transition.</p>

<h1>Bertrand Russell’s Ten Commandments of Critical Thinking and Democratic Decency</h1>
<ol>
<li>Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.</li> 
<li> Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.</li> 
<li> Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.</li> 
<li> When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by 	authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.</li> 
<li> Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.</li> 
<li> Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.</li> 
<li> Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.</li> 
<li> Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.</li> 
<li> Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.</li> 
<li> Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool’s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.</li>
